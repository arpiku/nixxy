# Abilities of Nixxy (TODO LIST):
  - Create notes and contexualise them and understand them while removing clutter:
    - Create Notes
      - Taggin information collected on the internet faster and locally.. 
      - I should be able to query Nixxy on things that I have learned... 
      - **Using notes to filter out garbage and incrementing the quality of information observed by me.**\
          - somehow avoid being an echo chamber, while also helping to learn quality shit.
      
    - Analyse Notes
    - Automate Note taking process
    - Retrieve notes easily
    - Push notes to a safe place
    - Manage pushing notes and creation of articles and stuff like that.

    - List of observable ability:
      - When downloading pdfs and pdf books it automatically tags them, syncs them on various devices, and 
      the notes and the pdfs are securely stored with custom DB, that is managed by it.
      - I can tell it what kind of book of information it is, and in what kind of situation I would like to be 
      able to access it.
      - When I am on a website, it can copy and store a given piece of code along with tags, time, what was this code used for?
      - What was the problem the code solved, what project were you doing back at time, and what did you like about
       that code... 
      - A everpresent tool that has and specific connection going in every app that is used by it, so it
      can make things happend Vivaldi, while also doing stuff in Freecad, if I am on GrabCad, then I should be able t
      import CAD models directly into FreeCAD.
      - When I watch a video, I should be able to make notes on things, that I am watching and compile those notes
      into an article perhaps faster.

      - These points make the need of Nixxy for me perhaps more clear, as the ability to consume information has increased 
      perhaps the ability to implement and execute on that information has not, and I want Nixxy to be able to do that, the problems I have
      already solved I want to use that knowledge directly and build upon it, instead continuosly repeating myself. 


      *Maybe Important*: But Nixxy doesn't delegate away the hard thinking part on the user, the level of problems being solved need
      to continuosly increase, i.e as Nixxy knows more and starts to grow.
      

     
 






























# Current list under consideration:

- nix (to be used as the language and package manager to get thigns done)
  - to add an action
