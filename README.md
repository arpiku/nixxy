nixxy is born.

Nixxy is command line tool that consolidates all of the repetitive tasks done my me on a daily bases.
The main goal with this project is to create a singular tool building on the power of open source cli tools as well as apis of operating
system and ai agents available online to make computing and working in general a smother experience for my personal use case. 
If you find anything interesting go ahead and fork and play around with the code

The goals of the project that I need to accomplish with this project are as follows:
  1. Delegate away a lot of the work
    - Once the input is given nixxy automatically performs the given task, here the purpose may
    seem similar to large action models, but nixxy is much more lighweight, and "AI" for now is unneccessary 
    burden for what I need to get done. These features when implemented look like:
      - Single commands to start a new project.
      - Automatic execution of repetitive tassk.
      - Voice Commands to do things like play song while coding** 
      - Taking data from a webpage creating a note.
      - Taking the data from chats with ChatGPT and clearing out the one's that I didn't like and 
      building a custom GPT personalised to my ChatGPT session(NOTE: Here the goal will be to keep nixxy completely
      open, one should be able to use nixxy to it's full ability without internet and ChatGPT, here when using ChatGPT, the AI
      part will speicifially refer to the management of data done through nixxy to allow better ChatGPT resutls, when if a full locally
      running llm is added to nixxy, then it must make sure it can exists without the internet).

    - It needs to help me gather information faster and learn better, that involves but not limited to:
      - Setting up automatic notes for new topic, maintaining and automatic order to notes.

    - Why do I need this piece of code?
     - I sometimes have spent hours configuring my workstations, and the security is always an issue, and all
    the note taking apps are garbage, I do not need a lot of the features that a lot of the software wished to
    throw at me, considering I am developer, I would like to spend time developing something for my needs that caters
    my usage of my system and helps me be more mindful of my learnings and my interations with my system, and the digital
    trail I leave behind. Nixxy is that, I don't want to manage all the different books I downloaded from various places,
    I don't want google to sync data, I want nixxy to do so, I want it to manage my passwords for me, I want it to the digital
    assistant with an AI that is tailored to me, it helps me keep my mail clean, my clander sorted, stops me from getting late for
    things, reminds me to get things done and teacher me new stuff every day. 
    Nixxy seems to be trying to do a bunch of things at once, but that is not the case...


  # On What Nixxy is trying to focus
  - Generally the idea with programming was always to get the computers to get do our bid, AI is just the next
  step towards achieving that goal, and we still have way to go. All the UX and different UIs were made so that
  people in an easier way can communicate to the machine what they want to get done, moving mouses to see email
  is fine and dandy, but as a developer I understand machines on a deeper level, and hence the machine should understand
  my actions at a deeper level too, LLMs provide a good starting point for collecion of information that I would have collected 
  over a lifetime being a software engineer, now I get that as my assistant and I can focus on building shiner, more precise and 
  bigger things faster. 
  That is the goal of Nixxy, if you are thinking "Jarvis" from Iron Man, well then yeah that would be the ultimate goal but not 
  as Software engineer only, but I would like the Nixxy to be actually capable of manufacturing something from scratch while it
  also is the one who helps me design it. 


  # Re-writing the points for clearer goal set:
  Nixxy ${time now - time first commit} seconds

  - Open Source Software cluster to use:
    - Nixxy will make use of a lot of external functionalities to achive it's goals, today gonna create some 
    of those functionalities
